Machine learning model to Stratify the Risk of Lymph Node Metastasis for Early Gastric Cancer

## **Abstract**
Endoscopic resection (ER) is a treatment option for clinically T1a early gastric cancer (EGC) without suspicion of lymph node metastasis (LNM). In patients with non-curative resection after ER, additional surgery is recommended owing to the LNM risk. However, of those patients treated with additional surgery after ER, the actual rate of LNM was about 5–10%; that is, the other patients underwent unnecessary surgeries. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate LNM risk in EGC patients to determine additional management after ER. We derived a machine learning (ML) model to stratify the LNM risk in EGC patients and validate its performance. The constructed ML model, which showed good performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.85 or higher, could stratify LNM risk into very low (<1%), low (<3%), intermediate (<7%), and high (≥7%)risk categories. These findings suggest that the ML model can stratify the LNM risk in EGC patients.
